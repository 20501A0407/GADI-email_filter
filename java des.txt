During my internship at BrainOvision Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I had the opportunity to enhance my technical and problem-solving skills while gaining hands-on experience in Java development. My primary focus was on understanding the development and testing of Java-based modules for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This allowed me to explore the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and gain insights into how enterprise applications are built and maintained.  
I learned the fundamentals of RESTful API development, including how APIs are structured, how they interact with different services, and how third-party services are integrated into a larger system. Additionally, I was introduced to unit testing with JUnit, where I practiced writing test cases to ensure code reliability and minimize bugs. This experience helped me understand the importance of writing clean, testable code.  

Working in an Agile development environment, I participated in sprint discussions and daily stand-up meetings, gaining exposure to Agile methodologies like Scrum. I also learned how to use Git for version control, understanding key operations like branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.  
Overall, this internship provided me with a strong foundation in Java, API development, unit testing, Agile methodologies, and version control. It strengthened my ability to learn new technologies, work collaboratively, and adapt to real-world development processes. This experience has motivated me to continue improving my skills and contribute effectively to future software development projects.
